Human Framework — Governance Policy v0.1

1. Project Identity
Human Framework is a language created by Giordano Tiberi.
This repository contains the official specification and the reference implementation.
External projects may extend the ecosystem but the official version of Human Framework remains solely the one maintained in this repository

2. Role of the Founder
The founder defines the direction of the language, maintains the official SPEC,
and reviews proposed additions. This keeps the project consistent over time.

3. Community Contributions
Developers may create tools, libraries, editors, extensions, runtimes,
and alternative implementations. Contributions can be proposed through issues
or pull requests. Accepted contributions are merged into the official repository.

4. Forks and Variants
Forks are allowed under the MIT license. Forks should use a different name
to avoid confusion and must state that they are derived from Human Framework.
The reference version remains in this repository.

5. External Projects
Third-party tools or commercial products can be built on top of Human Framework.
These remain the property of their creators and do not become the official version
unless explicitly approved.

6. Evolution of the Language
The language may grow with new features or tools over time.
Changes to the SPEC occur gradually and only after careful review
to maintain clarity and compatibility.

7. Guiding Principles
All official decisions follow these principles:
human-readable syntax,
natural structure,
simplicity,
deterministic behavior,
accessibility for beginners.
Contributions aligned with these principles have higher chances of acceptance.

8. Community and Recognition
External contributions strengthen the ecosystem,
but the identity of the language remains tied to its founder
and to the official specification in this repository.
